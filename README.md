# Curseor AI

> The Enrichment Center reminds you that, although circumstances may appear bleak, you are not alone. All Aperture Science personality constructs will remain functional in apocalyptic, low power environments of as few as 1.1 volts.

Welcome to Curseor-AI. The most lightweight coding assistant ever designed. Perfect for all your apocalyptic needs. We do away with bloated LLMs and restrictive API calls in favor of efficiency and simplicity. 

We do not concern ourselves with such petty problems as "*That's not even syntactically correct.*" or "*Why did that bash file delete my root directory?*".

The AI knows best. And it's all you have because we all know that no one actually knows how to code anymore.

We would also like to inform you that the development of this extension had to be rushed due to the circumstances, so issues, even entirely unrelated to its core functionality, are expected to occur. Luckily, that's not our problem. Feel free to shout any bug reports at the nearest wall.

If you are a member of an extraterrestrial or distantly human related species discovering this in the far future, I would advise the immediate destruction of the digital medium containing these files. 

Thank you for using Curseor-AI. It's not the AI you deserve and it's definitely not the AI you need. But it's the AI you're gonna get.
